Implementation of the Disjoint-Set data structure.
The Disjoint-Set, Also called a Union-Find or Merge-Find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets,
merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same or different sets.
